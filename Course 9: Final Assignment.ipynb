It is a highly developed market economy along with other countries such as Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan. Singapore is also ranked as one of the safest country in the world and with its excellent transportation and structures, it entices large amount of foreign investments. \n<br>\n<br>\nSingapore proud to have a diverse population. They have high tolerance on different races and religion. With this environment, it attracts expats from different parts of the world to settle or work there. With all the inconvenience and safety it has to offer, it is one of the best place for expats to live in. However, Singapore is also one of the densest country in the world. Rental prices are high and majority of the properties are provided by the government. Government housing are only available to Citizens and Permanent Residents. The only way for foreigners to have their own property is if it is a condomium. \n<br>\n<br>\nIn Singapore, \"Condo\" or \"Condominium\" are terms used for private housing development that comprises a collection of housing units with exclusive features like security guards, swimming pools and a gymnasium. Condominiums in Singapore come in the form of studio units, penthouse units, individual houses or multiple-room units.\n<br>\n<br>\nBuying condominiums can also be used as an investment as it can be rented straight away once received by its owner. This contribute to the increase in value of condominiums that are already build versus those that are on pre-sell. This opts buyers to purchase upcoming condominiums instead of those ready-made ones. \n<br>\n<br>\nWith high demand for up-coming condomiums, many property developers are trying to build as much as they can to fill-in the gap. This opens opportunities to Property Consultants to showcase and sell different properties to perspective buyers. Property consultants must have in-depth knowledge of the latest property trends and should assist buyers in finding the right houses for their buyers. ",
